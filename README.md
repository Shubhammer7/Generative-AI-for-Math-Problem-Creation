# Generative-AI-for-Math-Problem-Creation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an end-to-end solution for generating math problems using generative AI techniques. The model is being fine-tuned to improve its accuracy and relevance in creating diverse and challenging math problems. The entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and deployment, is containerized using Docker for seamless development and deployment.

## Key Features
End-to-End Pipeline: From data collection and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
Model Fine-Tuning: Continuous improvements and adaptations to ensure high-quality problem generation.
Dockerized Deployment: Easy to deploy and manage with Docker, ensuring consistency across different environments.
Scalable and Modular: Designed to be scalable and easily extendable for future improvements and additional features.
